Inherit Abstract User add phone number req field
CRUD Viewset for Resumes
User can Search by providing params(tags) like ("pyhton-4") in url to search (skill base or experience base)- [there is a mistake by short of time we should use APIviews with djangofilter backend and search filter apart from ModelViewset].
Because of short of time chains reference object not done, but we can use serializermethodField with recursive operation to provide a chain (user1 reference by user2) for this objective and modify abstract user with reference by field.
